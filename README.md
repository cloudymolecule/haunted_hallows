# README

Haunted Hallows allows people to gather up and discuss hauntings and paranormal happenings in a 'hotel' by booking a room.

## INSTALLATION

Fork and clone this repository, run 'bundle install' from the terminal to install the required gems. To run locally, fire up a server like the one included with rails by typing 'rails s'

## USAGE

Create and account or log in with Github, book a room and create a message board. Rooms can be set to private so other users can't access them.

## ROADMAP

In the future I'm planning to add multiple boards to each room and image support.
